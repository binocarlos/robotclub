# the only rule about robot club is that you MUST talk about robot club

## 1: disco

create a mini lighting rig that kids can manually control in time to music

## 2: football

make an analogue motor leg that kicks a football into a goal - there could be a goalkeeper also!

## 3: cars

make a car controlled in funky ways (TV control - voice activated etc)
